The x509.pfx was created by running:

makecert -sr LocalMachine -ss My -pe -n "CN=localhost" -a sha256 -len 1024 -r

and exporting the certificate from LocalMachine|My certificate store into x509.pfx, 
encrypted with `httpsys` password.

To configure the certificate to be used for HTTP.SYS, make sure it is available 
in the LocalMachine|My certificate store, then run:

netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8080 certhash=9c53ccbf622316f66770512815eedeec32a233aa appid={00112233-4455-6677-8899-AABBCCDDEEFE}

(The value of the certhash corresponds to the checked in x509.pfx; 
if another certificate was generated with makecert, that value needs to be updated)

To verify the certificate had been configured, run:

netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8080
